# User Guide: Building Your Professional Identity in Seconds

Welcome to the future of creative portfolios. This guide will help you navigate the platform and maximize the AI's potential.

## Step 1: Asset Ingestion
Don't worry about organization. Simply drag and drop your best work—photos, design files, or videos. 
- **Tip:** The AI performs best when you include at least 5-10 high-quality assets.
- **Automatic Metadata:** Our AI will automatically tag your work and suggest project descriptions based on the visual content.

## Step 2: Choose Your Aesthetic Intent
Select a "Vibe" that represents your brand:
- **Minimalist:** High whitespace, subtle typography (Ideal for UI/UX).
- **Editorial:** Bold headings, overlapping elements (Ideal for Fashion/Photography).
- **Brutalist:** Raw textures, high contrast, experimental layouts (Ideal for Digital Artists).

## Step 3: The AI Magic
Click **"Generate My Narrative."** Our AI Art Director will analyze your work's colors, themes, and shapes to build a custom website structure. This process takes 15-30 seconds.

## Step 4: Refine & Publish
Once generated, use the **Live Editor** to:
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Rearrange projects easily.
- **Regenerate Style:** Not feeling the font? Click "Shuffle Style" for a new AI-curated suggestion within your aesthetic profile.
- **Custom Domain:** Connect your own domain (e.g., `www.yourname.com`) and hit **Publish**.

## Troubleshooting
- **Site looks blurry?** Ensure your uploaded assets are at least 2000px wide.
- **Wrong color scheme?** You can manually adjust the "Primary Color" in the Styling tab to override the AI's selection.
